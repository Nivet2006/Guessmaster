# GuessMaster Game

Welcome to GuessMaster! This is a simple number guessing game built using Python.

In GuessMaster, the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player's task is to guess the number. The game provides feedback if the guess is too low or too high, helping the player narrow down their guesses.
